<h1>Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening</h1>

<br>
<br>

<p>

Whose woods these are I think I know.
<br>
His house is in the village, though; 
<br>
He will not see me stopping here
<br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

<br>
<br>

My little horse must think it queer
<br>
To stop without a farmhouse near
<br>
Between the woods and frozen lake
<br>
The darkest evening of the year.

<br>
<br>

He gives his harness bells a shake
<br>
To ask if there is some mistake.
<br>
The only other sound's the sweep
<br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.

<br>
<br>

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
<br>
But I have promises to keep,
<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,
<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.
